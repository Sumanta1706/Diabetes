# Diabetes
In this manuscript we have used, different classification models for the supervised methods. And for the unsupervised methods we have chosen ‘Principle Component Analysis’. We have taken steps to check whether the data has any auto-correlation or multi-co-linearity. This paper will introduce how to use medical data to predict an individual's diabetes with machine learning tools. The extreme gradient boosting which is the final model suggests that top five important features which  lead  to  high  probability  of  diabetes  are ‘Diabetes Pedigree Function’, ‘Pregnancies’, ‘BMI’, ‘Glucose’ and ‘Insulin’.
